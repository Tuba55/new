Aim: Program based on functions
1.Create a function in Python.
2.Create a function with variable length of arguments
3.Return multiple values from a function 
4.Create a function with a default argument .
5.Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way.

Exercise 1.Create a function in Python .Write a program a function that takes two arguments,name and age and print their values

Code:
#demo the function name
def demo_tuba(name,age):
#print value
    print(name,age)
#call function
demo_tuba("tuba",11)

Output:

2.Create a function with variable length of arguments
Write a program to create a function func1() to accept length of arguments and print their values
NOTE: Create a function in such a way that we pass any number of arguments to this function, and the function should process them and display each arguments value

Code:
def func1_tuba(*args):
    for i in args:
        print(i)
print()
print("1st Output")
func1_tuba(20,40,60)
print()
print("2nd Output")
func1_tuba(80,100)

Output:

3.Return multiple values from a function.Write a program to create a function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction.Also ,it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

Code:
def calculation_tuba(a,b):
    addition = a+b
    subtraction = a-b
#return multiple values separated by comma
    return addition,subtraction
#get result in tuple format
res = calculation_tuba(40,10)
print(res)

Output:

4. Create a function with a default argument .Write a program to create a function show_employeee() using the following condition. It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both .If the salary is missing in function call then assign default value to salary

Code:
#function with default argument
def show_employee_tuba(name,salary = 9000):
    print("Name:",name,"salary:",salary)
show_employee_tuba("Zia",12000)
show_employee_tuba("Tia")

Output:
5.Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way. Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b.At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it.

Code:
#outer function
def outer_fun_tuba(a,b):
    square = a**2
     #inner function
    def addition(a,b):
        return a+b
    #call inner function from outer function
    add = addition(a,b)
    #add 5 to the result
    return add + 5
result = outer_fun_tuba(5,10)
print(result)
